Tha algorithm consisted of a Mapper, Combiner and a Reducer. The Mapper cleaned the
input, tokenized the data and calculated the frequency of each word and each adjacent
word pair. The word and/or word pair were established as the keys and the frequencies 
were established as the values. The Combiner looped through all keys and their associated 
frequencies and combined the frequencies of matching keys. The Reducer used a Hash Map for 
single word frequencies and used it as a lookup to calculate the relative frequencies of the 
adjacent word pairs. The results were collected and written to the context, collected and 
outputted to HDFS.
