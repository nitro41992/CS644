- Commonly used Computing Paradigms
	- High-performance computing types: Super and Cluster computing
- Key Size conversion to Number of Alternative Keys
	- Time required to decrypt
		- Average (divide by 2) or worst case
- Terms of building a Supercomputer given peak computing power (how many, chips, cards, racks needed)
- Top three Supercomputers
- Communities and tech stacks across Communities
- Five Layers in Cloud Computing
	- Client
	- Application
	- Platform
	- Infrastructure
	- Server
- Regions and Availability Zones
- Names and main purpose of Hadoop Ecosystem
- 3 Hadoop execution modes
	- standalone
	- psuedo
	- fully
- HDFS
	- Write Once, Read Often
	- Data is immutable
	- How to set block size and replication number properly
		- Why replicate?
- Low-Level
	- HDFS
	- NFS (Linux FS)
-Key-Value Store
	-Primary for NoSQL databases
- Document Store
	- Difference between RDBMS
- Graph models
	- Challenges with linked data in RDBMS
		- Mitigation with graph models
- HBase
	- Structure: Stored in tables with rows, similar to RDBMS
	- Colimns are grouped into families
	- Family features
		- Compression
		- In-memory option
		- Stored together in a file called HFile/StoreFile
	- Bad for RDBMS data retreival
	- Distributed management architecture HBase
		- Table is divided into regions (Region Server)
			- Region size: 10 to 1000 regions
			- 1GB to 2 GB per regions
	- Need to know minor and major compaction
	- Able to store multiple versions of data in each cell (know how this is possible)
- Need to know YARN and execution dynamics in Hadoop 2
	- Where it is added in Hadoop 2
	- Need to know execution dynamics in Hadoop 1
- Spark
	- Suited for applications dealing with multiple iterations
	- Resilient distributed datasets (RDD)
		- Block is brought from disk into memory
			- Transformed and brought into memory
		- Once created, actions can eb applied without loading original data from storage
- Performance comparison between MapReduce and Spark
	- Hadoop is faster without repititions, otherwise, Spark is better
- Apache Storm
	- Topology
- Oozie workflows
	- How to trigger Oozie workflow?
	- What applications and jobs are supported?
- Pig
	- Dataflow language
		- Need Datasource
		- Functions are applied to datasource
- Apache Hive
	- Similar to SQL
